Step 3: Set up Firebase
Create a Firebase project by going to the Firebase Console.
Enable Firestore Database:
Go to the Firebase Console.
In the left-hand menu, click on Firestore Database.
Click on Create Database and follow the steps.
Add an Android app to your Firebase project:
In the Firebase console, click on the gear icon next to Project Overview, then select Project Settings.
Under Your apps, click on the Android icon to register your Android app.
Follow the instructions to download the google-services.json file.
Place the google-services.json file in your Flutter project's android/app/ directory.
Configure Firebase dependencies:
Ensure that your pubspec.yaml file includes the Firebase dependencies:
yaml
Copy code
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cloud_firestore: ^4.7.0
  firebase_core: ^2.5.0
Step 4: Configure Android settings
Make sure your android/app/build.gradle file contains the necessary Firebase configurations:

groovy
Copy code
dependencies {
    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.2.3')
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore'
}
Also, ensure that android/build.gradle has Google's Maven repository:

groovy
Copy code
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
Finally, at the bottom of your android/app/build.gradle file, apply the Google Services plugin:

groovy
Copy code
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
Step 5: Running the app
Run the app on an emulator or physical Android device using the following command:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
